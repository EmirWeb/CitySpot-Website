      <h3> Privacy Policy</h3>
         <h4>Effective Date:<h4>
          <p><small>May 10, 2014</small></p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of CitySpot. (“CitySpot”, “we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information in connection with the CitySpot applications (the “Applications”), www.cityspot.org (the “Site”) and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively with the Applications and the Site, the “Services”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) your use of the Services generally; and (ii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h4>I. Information Collection and Use</h4>
          <p>CitySpot does not collect any user identifable information</p>

          <p>We only use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Location information</strong></li>
            <li>When you use CitySpot, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What it doesn't cover?</h4>
          <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any partner content, third party websites, services, applications, hardware or equipment (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Services or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>

          <h3>When things change</h3>
          <h4>What Happens When These Privacy Policies Change?</h4>
          <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice to you or we may post an announcement via the Services. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement via the Services. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.</p>

          <!--  -->

          <h4>Do you have questions?</h4>
          <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at <a href='mailto:legal@cityspot.org'>legal@cityspot.org</a></p>
